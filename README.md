I have developed a practice project named "Kind Heart Charity" using ReactJS and its associated libraries. This project utilizes React Router for seamless navigation, Formik for efficient form handling, and Yup for robust form validation. Additionally, Swiper is used to create responsive and interactive sliders, while the Context API manages the application state. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling, ensuring a modern and consistent user interface.
